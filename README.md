# Switching Latent Bandits

-------------------------------------

This repository contains the code for the methods introduced in [1].

The repository is organized into separate directories for the proposed simulations, baseline policies, and data generation scripts.

Generated data can be found in the experiments directory.

The run_files directory contains scripts for executing experiments. Each script requires specific hyperparameters, which vary depending on the experiment.

The provided code primarily supports the experiments presented in Figures 1, 2, and 5. To replicate the other experiments, you can modify the hyperparameters in the available scripts.
